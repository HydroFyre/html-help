<h1>Hello. This is a guide on how to do basic HTML programming.</h1>
<p>This is a work in progress, and will get more extensive as time moves on. I am learning with you. I complile guides and give them to you in one big package, so you can learn everything here. I know that there are programs to instruct you on HTML all over the Internet, but I wanted to give you an actual coding environment, with hashtag comments for instructions, and otherwise leave you in the wild. You can also make small projects in my instructions, and send them to me with a simple fork.</p>
<h2>You are FREE to show me a something you did to my repository, anything you learned, and anything I could improve on.<h2>
<p>Please do not express your anger towards me, I am not a very accomplished programmer. My thanks.</p>
