# If you want to make an ordered list, use the <ol> tag with the <li> tag after it. You need to open and close the <li> tag
# for each item of the list. Look at the example below.
<ol><li>hello1</li>
<li>hello2</li>
<li>hello3</li></ol>

# That would give you a numbered list with each of those items, in this case "hello1", "hello2", and "hello3". If you want to make
# an unordered list with bullet points, use the <ul> tag instead, like this:
<ul><li>hello1</li>
<li>hello2</li>
<li>hello3</li></ul>

# That would replace the numbers with bullet points.
