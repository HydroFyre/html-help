# If you want to add a button that you can click on, use the <button> tag. A simple button would look like this:

<button type="button">Click this now!</button>

# This will give the viewer something to click on. Like the <a> tag, the entry tag encompasses a type, and then closes before
# the actual button text. After that, it ends.
