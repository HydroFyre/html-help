# Headings are simple, except you need to number them. For example, if this was your first heading in a website code,you would
# write the tag as <h1>. If it was your second, <h2>, and so on. Here's an example.
<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
<p>This is some text</p>
#Now I put a second heading:
<h2>Here is another heading!</h2>
<p>Here is more text</p>

# Remember to number your headings!
